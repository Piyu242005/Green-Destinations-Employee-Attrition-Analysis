Below is a short, easy, and professional explanation for how to address the HR Director's questions.

Objective Summary:
We have employee survey data and need to:

1. Calculate attrition rate.

2. Check if age, years at company, and income relate to attrition.

3. Attrition Rate
   Definition: Percentage of employees who have left the company.
   Formula:
   Attrition Rate = (Number of employees who left / Total employees) × 100

Example:
If 50 left out of 500 total → (50/500)*100 = 10% attrition rate.

2. Factors Influencing Attrition
   We check whether age, years of service, and income are related to leaving. Common method is to compare averages and run simple statistical models.

Simple Interpretation Approach:

* Age: Younger employees often leave more due to career exploration.
* Years at Company: Employees with fewer years may leave more because they are not yet attached or satisfied.
* Income: Lower income employees may leave for better opportunities.

Practical Analysis Steps:
a) Compare averages:
Check average age, years, and income for:

* Employees who left
* Employees who stayed

b) Build a simple model (Logistic Regression):
This predicts probability of leaving based on:

* Age
* YearsAtCompany
* MonthlyIncome

c) Interpret:
If a factor has a strong positive or negative effect, it means it influences attrition.

Expected Conclusion (Typical in HR Analytics):

* Younger + lower tenure + lower income groups often show higher attrition.
